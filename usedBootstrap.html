    <h2>Gestalt laws I tried to pay attention to:</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Law of Prägnanz: In all page elements I tried to keep it as simple as possible: to fewer rather than more elements, symmetrical rather than asymmetrical, e.g. center all images, choose only three images instead of many.
                </li>
            <li>Law of Continuity: I tried to arrange most objects in a line to facilitate grouping and comparison. I put the three pictures in the first section (What's special about me) in a line, as well as the logos of the universities.</li>
            <li>Law of Similarity: I used similar colours (only black and white for texts and not too many background colors) and always the same font with the same size. In order to encourage groupings of objects, I gave different sections different background colors.</li>
            <li>Law of Focal Point: I used a outstanding purple color to highlight the part with the feedback from former employers to create a focal point, because I think this part is very important. I also paid attention that buttons like the contact me button are outstanding in their choice of color.</li>
            <li>Law of Proximity: I wanted to group the information of my educational background together by putting the logos of the universities and the information in a line. I did the same for the "What's special about me" section.</li>
            <li>Law of Isomorphic Correspondence: Users are normally used to links that are blue and underlined, so I paid attention to make my links look like this. As my background is blue, too, I changed the color for readability. I also put the navbar on top of the page as well as the search bar, because people are used to this.</li>
            <li>Law of Figure/Ground: I tried to make sure that there is enough contrast between  foreground and background by choosing text and background colors that go well together (black or white text fitting to background color). </li>
            <li>Law of Common Fate: I tried to adhere to this law by using tool tips. </li>
        </ul>
